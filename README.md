## Day 1

I added the basic structure of a web page, and I created a JavaScript file that has an employee constructer, and I added some prototype methods like calSalary for calculating the salary and render method for displaying the employee salary and name.

## Day 2

I added new form for employee Registration in index.html, and I added an event handler for the form, so when a new employee added to the list, a card will be rendered in index.html and in the section of which department he registered in.

## Day 3

I used local storage to save all employees wither if it was hardcoded or registered by the form, and I used local storage to retrieve employee's data in accounting page to render a table that has each department information and all departments
